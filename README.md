**Instructions:**
1. To run the code you must first run the command: <br> ````pip install psycopg2```` <br>
2. Next need to create database called ````Assignment3```` and also have a user named ````postgres```` and corresponding password ````admin````. You may also edit the code at the line inside main.py where the script connects to the database to your desired parameters instead.
3. Then inside pgAdmin4 you can import the setup.sql file to set up the ````students```` table and the initial data
4. Then to run the code you can either just press run inside VSCode like in the demo or in a command prompt reach the current directory where the code is located and then type the command: <br> ````python main.py````
